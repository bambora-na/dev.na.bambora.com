# Commissions Report

## Report Overview

The Commissions Report is intended for our Partners to obtain an overview of their FlexCommissions payouts. 
Partners can get information relating to commissions being paid or that have been paid. 

## Report Columns

The response will be a JSON-formatted response which will consist of a collection
of `Commission` records.  The fields of each `Commission` are
summarized in the table below.

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `row_id` | The id of the commission |
| `payout_id` | The payout id of the commission |
| `amount` | Commission amount |
| `start_datetime` | Commission payout start date |
| `end_datetime` | Commission payout end date |
| `expected_settlement_date` | Expected date the Commission payout will be recieved by Partner |
| `statement_id` | The statement id associated with the payout |
| `status` | The status of the payout |

More detailed information about these fields can be found in our API
specification which can be found at:
<https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/references/payment_APIs/v1-0-5/>

## Getting Started

The Commissions Report API is accessed via the URL
<https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/reports/commissions>

In addition, you will need to use your Merchant ID and Reporting API Access
Passcode from your Bambora Channel Partner account.  See the "Authentication" section below
for more details on how to generate your access passcode to use in the request
to the Merchant Report API.

## API Requests

### Request Headers

Requests to the merchant endpoint should include two request headers:
a `Content-type` header with the value `application/json` and a `Authorization`
header which is outlined in the next section.

### Authentication

All requests to the Merchant Report require authentication in the form of an
`Authorization` header.  This header contains the value `Passcode <YOUR API
ACCESS PASSCODE>` which is an encoded version of your Merchant ID and your
Reporting API Access Passcode.  Note that your Reporting API Access Passcode can
be found in the [Portal](https://web.na.bambora.com) under
**administration** > **account settings** > **order settings**.

`<YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>` is created by concatenating your Merchant ID to
your Reporting API Access Passcode (separated by a colon), and then base 64
encoding the result.

As an example, if your Merchant ID is 123456789, and your Reporting API Passcode
is `fd36d245a3584434b904096525547f17`, then using Javascript your API Access
Passcode could be generated by doing:

```javascript
merchantID = "123456789";
reportingAPIPasscode = "fd36d245a3584434b904096525547f17";

// base 64 encode the two values concatenated with a colon
yourAPIAccessPassCode = btoa(merchantID + ":" + reportingAPIPasscode);
```

In this example `yourAPIAccessPassCode` would be
`MTIzNDU2Nzg5OmZkMzZkMjQ1YTM1ODQ0MzRiOTA0MDk2NTI1NTQ3ZjE3` which is the value
used when making a call to the Merchant Report API.

Alternatively, for convenience, you can also use the
[form](https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/forms/encode_api_passcode/) which does the
same calculation.

It is worth noting that while this process obfuscates/obscures your Reporting
API Passcode it is not an *encrypted* value, so this value should be treated with
equal sensitivity/security as your Reporting API Passcode itself.

### Parameters

The Commissions Report can accept parameters to control the data returned by
the endpoint: `commissions`, which is supplied as part of the URL

If no parameters are passed the data returned will be for all the commissions of the Channel Partner requesting the report.

### Example

An example request to get commission passing with parameters is illustrated below. All parameters are optional.

#### Request

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/reports/commissions/?report_days=180&from_date=2022-09-14&to_date=2022-12-14&filter_by=status&filter_value=approved&start_row=1&end_row=4&version=2' \
--header 'Authorization: Passcode <YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Replace `<YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>` with your API passcode.

If you wish to retrieve information for all of your commissions then the request would be:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/reports/commissions' \
--header 'Authorization: Passcode <YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Response

```javascript
{
    "data": [
        [
            {
                "row_id": 1,
                "payout_id": 26,

            {
                "row_id": 2,
                "payout_id": 28,

                "expected_settlement_date": "2022-12-09T00:00:00",
                "statement_id": 1003119006,
                "status": "Approved"
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```
