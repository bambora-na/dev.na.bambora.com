# Checkout

<br>Checkout allows you to accept payments online with just one link. It is a hosted payment form that supports payment cards and [Visa Secure Remote Commerce (SRC)](https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/guides/visa_checkout). You can link to Checkout from your website or from an email, allowing it to slot into either a shopping cart flow or an invoicing flow.
This guide will show you how to create a form and a link before sending it out to clients, customers, and donors

This guide will show you how to create a form and a link before sending it out to clients, customers, and donors.

## Example
A common use of Checkout would involve hosting a link or a button on your own website that would then redirect the user to the Checkout product hosted on Worldlineâ€™s services.

Try it out! Click the "Pay" button below. You can use using the test card number **4030 0000 1000 1234**, with a security code **123** and any expiry date in the future. Checkout will open in a new tab.

<a href="https://web.na.bambora.com/scripts/payment/payment.asp?merchant_id=300204468&trnAmount=10.00&hashValue=198b1de5fae8e1671bdf720cbbf292e15671dfaa" class="btn btn-small"
target="\_blank" style="word-spacing: .3em; letter-spacing: .05em;
        padding-left:40px; padding-right:40px;">Pay $10</a>

See a [demo](https://demo.na.bambora.com/checkout.html) of a complete payment flow using Checkout, and view the [source](https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo).

Please note when using 3DS, Cardholder Name and either Billing Email or Billing Phone Number are **mandatory** for Visa.

## Custom Checkout vs Checkout

Checkout is an alternative to building your own payment form with Custom Checkout.

* Both solutions are PCI SAQ A compliant.
* Checkout is a payment form - it takes payments. Custom Checkout is a tokenizaton library - it returns a token that you can pass to the Payment API to take a payment.
* Checkout involves redirecting the user to a payment form on bambora.com. Custom Checkout embeds Worldline hosted input fields in your webpage.
* Checkout is not brandable. [Custom Checkout](https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/guides/custom_checkout/) allows you to build a fully customized payment form - you retain as much control over UI/UX as you do with native DOM elements.
